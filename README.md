## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was quite challenging for me. I could not figure out how to transition from desktop to mobile in flexbox. I am not quite comfortable with grid yet so I had to use flexbox. The mobile design was really hard to perfect. My friend raghav also helped me in the mobile design. Eventually I had to take help of chatgpt and I did learnt quite new stuff.


### Continued development

I will be learnign more about responsive designs and css grid layout.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This is an amazing resource to learn css. I went through this a lot.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Another amazing resource to learn pretty much everything relaated to html, css and js. I also used this as my resource.
- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - Chatgpt also helped me a lot.
